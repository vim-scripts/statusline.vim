         Thanks for xiaohuyee to give us such a pretty gift. 
          He did most of the work. I just stood on his shoulders.
          
         I am looking for a beautiful vim statusline for a long time but found nothing until I met the light2011.
         Last night I spent several hours to beautify my statusline, it looks good.
         And now I give it to you.

         It is beautiful on gvim. 
         However if you use vim on console, it is still useful, but not so beautiful.

Tutorial
         Download it, use it, and change it.
         It is good on my laptop, but maybe bad on yours.  
         Perhaps you should edit the source code to suit your vim.
         When you edit it, do not erase trailing-blanks.
         If you use light2011, you'd better comment its statusline codes.
